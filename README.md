# todo-list-backend
This is part of a project for a simple todo-list app. It contains a database and a RESTful API for the app.           

Function of the App:
1. Create a task
2. Read a task
3. Update a task
4. Delete a task
5. Marking a task complete

A task will have up to 3 categories. Maybe a user signin will be added later.       

How to Implement:
1. SQL (probably SQLite)
2. RESTful API using Flask
